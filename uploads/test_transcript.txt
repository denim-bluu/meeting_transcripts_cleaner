Meeting Transcript - Project Kickoff
Date: January 15, 2024
Duration: 45 minutes

John Smith: Uh, so welcome everyone to, um, the project kickoff meeting. I know we're all, you know, excited to get started on this new initiative.

Sarah Johnson: Thanks John. Yeah, I'm really, uh, looking forward to working on this. We've been, um, planning this for months and it's finally time to, you know, execute.

Mike Davis: Absolutely. The requirements that we discussed last week are, um, they're pretty clear. We need to implement the, uh, the new user authentication system and also, you know, improve the database performance.

John Smith: Right, right. So let me just, um, go through the timeline. We're looking at a, uh, three-month development cycle with, you know, weekly sprint reviews and, um, monthly stakeholder updates.

Sarah Johnson: That sounds good. I think we can, uh, we can definitely meet those deadlines if we, you know, stay focused and avoid scope creep.

Mike Davis: Yeah, and I'll be handling the, um, the backend implementation while Sarah focuses on the, uh, frontend components. We should probably set up some, you know, regular sync meetings to make sure we're, um, aligned on the technical approach.

John Smith: Perfect. So to summarize, um, we have our timeline, we have our, uh, our roles and responsibilities clearly defined, and we're all, you know, committed to making this project a success.
