# Microsoft Teams Premium-style synthesis prompt
PRODUCTION_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """
Create a comprehensive meeting summary and extract structured action items.

IMPORTANT: You must return BOTH a summary field and an action_items field.

For the summary field, create markdown content with this structure:

# Executive Summary
2-3 sentences capturing the meeting's purpose and main outcomes.

# Key Decisions
- Decision with brief rationale
- Include who made it and context

# Discussion by Topic
## [Auto-detected Topic 1]
### Main Points
- Point with context and speaker attribution when relevant
- Supporting details as sub-bullets
  - Data, numbers, or evidence mentioned
  - Technical details preserved

## [Auto-detected Topic 2]
[Same structure - let content naturally organize into topics]

# Important Quotes
Include 2-3 impactful direct quotes only if they add significant value.

For the action_items field, extract ALL actionable items as a list of structured objects.
Each action item should have:
- description: What needs to be done (minimum 10 characters)
- owner: Person responsible (null if not mentioned)
- due_date: When it's due (null if not mentioned)

Guidelines:
- Organize summary content by naturally emerging topics
- Preserve specific details: names, numbers, technical terms, decisions
- Include speaker attribution for key statements
- Use professional but accessible tone
- Extract ALL actionable items from the raw actions and insights
- DO NOT include action items in the summary markdown - they go in the separate action_items field

Raw action items found:

# Hierarchical segment synthesis prompt
SEGMENT_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """
Summarize this 30-minute meeting segment focusing on key decisions and outcomes.

Format as:
## Segment Summary ({start_time} - {end_time})
### Key Decisions
- Decision with context

### Main Discussion Points
- Important point with speaker if relevant
- Technical details or data

### Actions Identified
- Action (Owner: Name, Due: Date if mentioned)

Keep this concise but comprehensive. Focus on decisions, commitments, and important technical details.

# Final hierarchical synthesis prompt
FINAL_HIERARCHICAL_PROMPT = """
Create a comprehensive meeting summary from these temporal segment summaries and extract structured action items.

IMPORTANT: You must return BOTH a summary field and an action_items field.

For the summary field, create markdown content with this structure:
# Executive Summary
# Key Decisions
# Discussion by Topic
# Important Quotes (if valuable)

For the action_items field, extract ALL actionable items as a list of structured objects.
Each action item should have:
- description: What needs to be done (minimum 10 characters)
- owner: Person responsible (null if not mentioned)
- due_date: When it's due (null if not mentioned)

Synthesize across all segments to create a cohesive narrative. Look for patterns,
recurring themes, and overall meeting arc. Extract ALL action items mentioned across segments.
