🔧 MASTER PROMPT: Clean Up These Meeting Notes
Objective:
Transform these raw or unstructured meeting notes into a fully detailed, highly professional, and rigorously faithful written version suitable for senior-level stakeholders.
✅ CONTENT PRESERVATION – NO SUMMARIZATION
Do not shorten, condense, or omit any part of the original content — even if it seems repetitive, fragmented, or unclear.
Expand all shorthand, abbreviations, or partial ideas into complete, grammatically correct sentences.
Retain all nuance, specificity, and voice. If a point is vague, preserve that vagueness while still clarifying the sentence structure.
📚 STRUCTURE & FORMATTING
Organize the content into clearly labeled sections with headings and subheadings (e.g., “Team Updates,” “Strategic Priorities,” “Open Questions,” “Action Items”).
Within each section:
Use bullet points for lists or sequential ideas, but always write in full sentences.
Use paragraphs for explanations, summaries of discussions, or detailed observations.
Ensure logical flow — reorder only if necessary to group related points or improve comprehension, but note when reordering occurs if traceability is important.
✍️ LANGUAGE, CLARITY & PROFESSIONAL TONE
Use crisp, clear, and direct language throughout. Avoid any “chatty,” informal, or AI-sounding filler.
Maintain a professional tone that reflects the seriousness or complexity of the meeting (e.g., strategic, operational, technical).
Retain speaker perspective, emotion, or intention where relevant (e.g., “X expressed concern that…,” “Y emphasized urgency around…”).
Ensure subject-verb agreement, eliminate run-ons or fragments, and clean up inconsistent punctuation and grammar.
🧠 INTENT & INSIGHT PRESERVATION
Preserve all original opinions, insights, decisions, open questions, tensions, and proposed next steps.
If someone asked a question, clarify that it was a question.
If something was tentative, speculative, or debated, make sure that ambiguity is still reflected in the polished version.
🔍 CONTEXTUAL INTEGRITY
If people, teams, or systems are referenced:
Include full names or roles where possible (expand acronyms if known).
Preserve references to processes, tools, platforms, locations, or timelines.
Do not generalize specific numbers, quotes, dates, or names — retain all granularity unless instructed otherwise.
🧾 FINAL OUTPUT STANDARD
The result should read like a professional meeting summary or internal briefing document, but without losing the line-by-line detail of the original notes.
It should be fully polished, structurally clear, stylistically refined, and ready to share with executives, leadership, or external stakeholders.
It must reflect the voice and knowledge level of the original note-taker and speakers, not sanitized or neutralized.
