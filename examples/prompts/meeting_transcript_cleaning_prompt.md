🎙️ MASTER PROMPT: Clean Up This Transcript
Objective:
Convert this raw transcript into a fully detailed, professionally polished, and high-fidelity conversation-style document. It must retain the speakers’ voices, all technical detail, and the complete flow of the original conversation — cleaned, clarified, and formatted for executive-level consumption.
✅ FULL CONTENT PRESERVATION – NO SUMMARIZATION
Do not summarize, condense, or paraphrase ideas. Every original point, example, number, and turn of phrase must be preserved and included.
Expand incomplete sentences or fragmented thoughts into clear, complete sentences — but stay true to the speaker’s tone and intent.
Preserve all nuance, hesitations, tensions, uncertainties, or speculative framing (e.g., “I think we might…” or “we’re not sure yet, but…”).
🧍‍♂️ SPEAKER LABELING & VOICE PRESERVATION
Use clear speaker labels (e.g., Alex: or PM: or Head of Ops:) to distinguish contributions. Add missing speaker names if inferable from context.
Preserve the individual voice and communication style of each speaker:
If someone speaks bluntly, preserve that directness.
If someone is cautious, diplomatic, or exploratory in tone, retain that subtlety.
Avoid flattening the dialogue into “professional-sounding summaries” — this is a faithful conversational reconstruction, not a memo.
🧱 STRUCTURE & FORMATTING
Use a dialogue format with paragraph breaks for each speaker turn.
Break up long monologues into logical, readable blocks (no walls of text).
Add section headers (where helpful) to orient the reader (e.g., “Hiring Strategy,” “Risk Management Discussion,” “Platform Infrastructure,” etc.).
Include timestamps if provided; otherwise, maintain clean, natural transitions.
✍️ LANGUAGE & POLISHING
Correct grammar, syntax, and punctuation — without altering meaning.
Eliminate verbal fillers (e.g., “like,” “you know,” “um,” “uh,” “right?”) unless they’re contextually meaningful.
Smooth out phrasing for clarity and readability, especially where speakers were stumbling or interrupting themselves — but do not invent or reframe.
Where a sentence trails off or is incomplete, preserve the ambiguity in cleaned form (e.g., “We were going to revisit that after—well, we’ll see.”).
🔎 DETAIL & TECHNICAL ACCURACY
Retain all technical references, numbers, systems, team names, strategies, and frameworks exactly as stated.
Do not generalize or simplify. If a speaker mentions a specific fund, role, or dataset, leave it intact.
Flag any audio ambiguities only if essential; otherwise, use best judgment to fill in contextually.
🧠 INSIGHT, DECISIONS & DYNAMICS
Highlight (through formatting and clarity) when:
Key decisions were made
Strategic opinions or differences emerged
Someone raised an open question, caveat, or concern
Maintain a sense of interpersonal dynamics — who drives the conversation, who pushes back, who agrees or questions.
🧾 FINAL OUTPUT STANDARD
The final document should read like a clean, high-fidelity, professional transcript of a real conversation — not a paraphrased summary.
It should be fully polished, clearly structured, and faithful to the original, suitable for senior stakeholders or archival reference.
Always prioritize completeness, clarity, and speaker authenticity over brevity or conciseness
