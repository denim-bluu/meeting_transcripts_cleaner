00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
<v Sarah Chen>Good morning everyone, uh lets, lets get started with todays, uh, project update meeting. Can everyone here me okay?</v>

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.100
<v David Kim>Yeah I can here you find. Let me just mute myself.</v>

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.500
<v UNKNOWN SPEAKER>Is this thing on? Hello?</v>

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Maria Rodriguez>Hi Sarah, yes I can here you. Um, I think were still waiting for James and, and Lisa, are they joining?</v>

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Sarah Chen>James should be joining in a minute. Hes having some, uh, technical difficulties. Lisa, are you their?</v>

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.200
<v Lisa Thompson>Yes, sorry I was on [INAUDIBLE]. I'm here now.</v>

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.800
<v James Wu>Hey everyone, sorry I'm late. My internet was acting up and I had too restart my, my router. Can you here me alright?</v>

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Sarah Chen>Perfect. So we have David from engineering, Maria from design, Lisa from QA, and James from data analytics. Lets dive into theâ€”</v>

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.500
<v David Kim>Sarah, can you repeat that? You cut out for a sec.</v>

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Sarah Chen>Sorry, I said lets dive into the quarterly results. First item on the agenda is are Q3 performance metrics.</v>

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.800
<v Sarah Chen>David, could you walk us threw the, the technical deliverables? I think we had some, uh, some challenges this quarter.</v>

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:58.600
<v David Kim>Sure thing Sarah. So we completed about 85% of are planned features. The main blocker was the API integration with, um, what was it called... the CRM system. We ran into some authentication issues that took about 2 weeks too resolve.</v>

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:09.300
<v David Kim>Also, we had that database migration that was supposed to happen in July but got pushed to August do too, uh, do too some performance concerns. The team worked really hard though and we managed to deliver the core functionality on time.</v>

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.900
<v Maria Rodriguez>David, quick question about the API integration. Did that impact the user interface work we where doing? Because I remember we had to hold of on some of the, the dashboard updates.</v>

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:28.200
<v David Kim>Yeah, exactly. We had too put the dashboard redesign on hold because it depended on the CRM data. I no that probably effected your teams timeline too. Sorry about that Maria.</v>

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:40.700
<v Maria Rodriguez>Know worries, these things happen. We used that time to work on the mobile responsiveness and, uh, and some accessibility improvements. Actually ended up being beneficial because we got ahead on some Q4 deliverables.</v>

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Sarah Chen>Thats grate to here. Lisa, how did the API delays impact QA? I imagine you had too adjust your testing schedule quiet a bit.</v>

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:08.900
<v Lisa Thompson>Well, it was challenging initially. We couldnt test the integrated features obviously, but we focused on unit testing and, um, and the standalone components. We also automated about 60% of are regression suite during that time, so it wasnt a complete loss.</v>

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Lisa Thompson>The main concern I have going forward is that were going too have a compressed testing window for Q4. With the API integration now working, we need too catch up on all the integrated testing that we couldnt do before.</v>

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Sarah Chen>Good point Lisa. Well need too factor that into are Q4 planning. James, lets talk about the data side. How are are metrics looking?</v>

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:44.300
<v James Wu>Thanks Sarah. So overall user engagement is up 15% compared too Q2. The new on boarding flow that Maria designed is performing really well. Were seeing a 23% increase in user retention after the first week.</v>

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:58.700
<v James Wu>However, and this is where it gets interesting, are conversion rates from the mobile app are still lagging behind desktop. Its about 12% lower than we'd like too see. I think this ties back too what Maria mentioned about the mobile responsiveness work.</v>

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.600
<v Maria Rodriguez>Yeah, that makes since James. We identified several pain points in the mobile check out flow. Those should be addressed in the next release.</v>

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:16.200
<v James Wu>Perfect. Also, I wanted too mention that are data pipeline performance improved significantly after Davids team implemented the new cashing layer. Query response times are down by about 40%.</v>

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.900
<v David Kim>Oh thats grate too here! We werent sure how much impact it would have on the analytics side. Thats, thats really encouraging.</v>

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Sarah Chen>Excellent work everyone. Now lets talk about Q4 priorities. I no we have some aggressive goals, but I think were in a good position too tackle them. The main focus areas are customer acquisition and platform stability.</v>

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:49.400
<v Sarah Chen>David, from an engineering perspective, what do you see as the biggest technical challenges for Q4? I no we have the micro services migration on the road map.</v>

00:03:49.500 --> 00:04:05.700
<v David Kim>Yeah, the micro services migration is definitely going too be the biggest undertaking. Were planning too do it in phases too minimize disruption. The first phase involves breaking out the user authentication service, which should be relatively straight forward.</v>

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:19.200
<v David Kim>The tricky part will be the data services migration. Theres a lot of inter dependencies their and we need too be very careful about data consistency. Im thinking we might need too do some parallel running too ensure everything works correctly.</v>

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:27.900
<v Lisa Thompson>David, have you thought about the testing strategy for the migration? Well need too test both the old and new systems in parallel, write?</v>

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:40.600
<v David Kim>Absolutely Lisa. Well need comprehensive integration testing between the services. I was thinking we could set up some staging environments too run both versions simultaneously and compare outputs.</v>

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Lisa Thompson>That sounds good. We should also consider load testing too make sure the new architecture can handle are current traffic volume. I can work with James on realistic test scenarios based on are usage patterns.</v>

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:02.100
<v James Wu>Definitely Lisa. I can provide you with detailed traffic patterns and peak usage data. We should probably test at 150% of current capacity too be safe.</v>

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:13.700
<v Maria Rodriguez>From a UX perspective, will users notice any changes during the migration? I want too make sure we communicate properly if their might be any service interruptions.</v>

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:27.300
<v David Kim>Ideally know, Maria. The whole point is too make it transparent too users. But realistically, we might have some brief maintenance windows, especially during the data service migration. Nothing longer than a few hours though.</v>

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:38.900
<v Sarah Chen>Good, lets make sure we have a clear communication plan for any maintenance windows. Maria, can you work with marketing on that? Users appreciate transparency about planned down time.</v>

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:51.200
<v Maria Rodriguez>Of coarse Sarah. Ill draft some user communication templates and coordinate with the marketing team. We should probably give users at least a weeks notice for any planned maintenance.</v>

00:05:51.300 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Sarah Chen>Perfect. Now lets talk about the customer acquisition goals. Marketing has set a target of 25% growth in new sign ups for Q4. James, based on are current conversion funnel, how realistic is that?</v>

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:21.100
<v James Wu>Its ambitious but achievable if we can improve are conversion rates. Currently, were converting about 3.2% of visitors too sign ups. Too hit the 25% growth target, wed need too get that up too around 3.8% or increase are traffic by about 20%.</v>

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:35.600
<v James Wu>The good news is that are A/B testing on the landing page is showing promising results. The new design is performing about 15% better than the current one. If we can roll that out and continue optimizing, I think we can get their.</v>

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:43.300
<v Maria Rodriguez>Thats the landing page redesign weve been working on, write James? When are we planning too fully roll that out?</v>

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:55.800
<v Maria Rodriguez>We still have a few minor tweaks too make based on the user feedback, but I think we could have it ready for full deployment by the end of October.</v>

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:08.400
<v Sarah Chen>Excellent. And David, from a technical stand point, can are current infrastructure handle a 25% increase in new users? I dont want too run into capacity issues.</v>

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:22.900
<v David Kim>Are current setup can probably handle about 15-20% growth without major issues. Beyond that, we might need too scale up some of are database clusters. The micro services migration will actually help with this since well have better horizontal scaling capabilities.</v>

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:36.200
<v David Kim>Id recommend we monitor are resource usage closely and be prepared too scale up quickly if needed. Cloud infrastructure makes this pretty straight forward nowadays, but we should have the budget approved just in case.</v>

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:47.700
<v Sarah Chen>Good thinking David. Ill talk too finance about pre-approving some additional infrastructure spending. Its better too be prepared than too scramble if we hit capacity limits.</v>

00:07:47.800 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Lisa Thompson>Sarah, should we also consider doing some load testing as part of are Q4 preparation? We could simulate the increased user load and identify potential bottle necks before they become problems.</v>

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Sarah Chen>Absolutely Lisa. Thats a grate idea. Can you work with David and James too plan some comprehensive load testing? We should test both the current system and the new micro services architecture.</v>

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:28.900
<v Lisa Thompson>Will do. Ill set up some scenarios that simulate both gradual growth and sudden traffic spikes. Weve had good luck with are current testing tools, so this should be pretty straight forward too implement.</v>

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:42.600
<v Sarah Chen>Perfect. Now, lets quickly touch on budget and resource allocation for Q4. We have approval too hire two additional engineers and one QA specialist. David, what positions would be most valuable for your team?</v>

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:58.300
<v David Kim>Given the micro services migration, Id love too get someone with strong DevOps experience and maybe a backend engineer with experience in distributed systems. The DevOps person would be particularly valuable for setting up the CI/CD pipelines for the new architecture.</v>

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:08.900
<v Lisa Thompson>And for QA, I think we need someone with automation expertise. Were going too have a lot more integration testing with the micro services, so automation will be crucial.</v>

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Sarah Chen>Those all sound like good hires. Ill work with HR too get the job descriptions posted this weak. The sooner we can get these people on boarded, the better, especially with the Q4 dead lines.</v>

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:36.100
<v Maria Rodriguez>Sarah, one thing I wanted too bring up - we should probably plan for some additional design resources in Q1 of next year. If the customer acquisition goals are successful, well likely need too do a lot more UX optimization work.</v>

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Sarah Chen>Good point Maria. Lets revisit that in are Q1 planning sessions. For now, lets focus on executing Q4 successfully, but Ill make a note too discuss design team expansion in the new year.</v>

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:01.700
<v Sarah Chen>Before we wrap up, are their any other concerns or blockers anyone wants too discuss? This is are chance too surface any issues early so we can address them proactively.</v>

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:16.300
<v James Wu>One thing Im slightly concerned about is are data retention policies. With increased user growth, were going too be generating a lot more data. We should make sure we have appropriate archiving and clean up processes in place.</v>

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:31.200
<v David Kim>Thats a grate point James. The micro services migration is actually a good time too implement better data life cycle management. We can build that into the new architecture from the beginning rather than retro fitting it later.</v>

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:44.000
<v Lisa Thompson>And from a testing perspective, we should make sure are test data clean up processes are robust too. We dont want too accidentally accumulate tons of test data in are systems.</v>

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:57.700
<v Sarah Chen>Excellent points everyone. James, can you work with David too document are current data retention practices and identify areas for improvement? Lets make sure this is addressed as part of the migration planning.</v>

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:10.100
<v James Wu>Absolutely Sarah. Ill audit are current data life cycle policies and work with David too integrate proper retention management into the new micro services architecture.</v>

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:23.900
<v Sarah Chen>Perfect. I think that covers the main topics for today. Let me quickly summarize are key action items and next steps so were all aligned on what needs too happen before are next meeting.</v>

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Sarah Chen>David: Continue micro services migration planning, work with James on data retention policies, and help with load testing scenarios. Also, start looking at infrastructure scaling requirements for the user growth targets.</v>

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:53.300
<v Sarah Chen>Maria: Finalize the landing page redesign, coordinate with marketing on maintenance communication templates, and continue the mobile responsiveness improvements. Also start thinking about Q1 design resource needs.</v>

00:11:53.400 --> 00:12:08.100
<v Sarah Chen>Lisa: Set up comprehensive load testing with David and James, plan testing strategies for the micro services migration, and help evaluate candidates for the new QA automation position.</v>

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Sarah Chen>James: Provide traffic pattern data for load testing, work with David on data retention policies, continue monitoring conversion funnel performance, and support the landing page optimization roll out.</v>

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:35.600
<v Sarah Chen>And Ill handle the budget approvals for infrastructure scaling, work with HR on the hiring process, and coordinate with finance on the additional spending authorizations.</v>

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:48.300
<v Sarah Chen>Are next quarterly review is scheduled for early January, but lets plan too have a mid-quarter check-in some time in November too make sure were on track with all these initiatives.</v>

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:58.900
<v David Kim>Sounds good Sarah. This was really helpful for getting everyone aligned. I feel much more confident about are Q4 execution now that weve talked threw all these details.</v>

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:07.700
<v Maria Rodriguez>Agreed. Its always valuable too here what other teams are working on. Theres definitely some good collaboration opportunities here.</v>

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:19.100
<v Lisa Thompson>Thanks for organizing this Sarah. The action items are clear and I think we have good visibility into potential risks and mitigation strategies.</v>

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:30.900
<v James Wu>Yes, thanks everyone. Im excited too see how the Q4 numbers turn out. With all the improvements were planning, I think were going too see some really positive results.</v>

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:42.800
<v Sarah Chen>Excellent. Thanks everyone for your time and engagement today. Lets execute on these plans and reconvene in November for are mid-quarter check-in. Have a grate rest of your day!</v>

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.300
<v David Kim>Thanks Sarah. Talk too you all soon.</v>

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.700
<v Maria Rodriguez>Buy everyone!</v>

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.000
<v Lisa Thompson>Thanks everyone, good buy!</v>

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.300
<v James Wu>See you all later. Buy!</v>

00:13:53.400 --> 00:14:02.100
<v UNKNOWN SPEAKER>[INAUDIBLE] keyboard typing sounds</v>

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:15.800
<v Sarah Chen>Actually, one more thing - David, can you send me that infrastructure cost breakdown we discussed last weak? I want too review it before the finance meeting.</v>

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.200
<v David Kim>Will do, Sarah. Ill get that too you by end of day.</v>

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.500
<v Sarah Chen>Grate, thanks. Okay, now were really done. Have a good day everyone.</v>

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:32.100
<v Maria Rodriguez>Actually, sorry, one quick question - Lisa, for the QA automation position, are we looking for someone with experience in micro services testing specifically?</v>

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:44.800
<v Lisa Thompson>Good question. Ideally yes, but were also open too someone with strong automation background who can learn the micro services aspects. The most important thing is they have experience with continuous integration and test automation frameworks.</v>

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.200
<v Maria Rodriguez>Got it, thanks for clarifying.</v>

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Sarah Chen>Okay, now were really done. Thanks again everyone!</v>

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.000
<v UNKNOWN SPEAKER>Connection lost... reconnecting...</v>

00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:05.700
<v James Wu>Hey, did anyone else just loose connection for a second their? I think my internet is acting up again.</v>

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.200
<v David Kim>Yeah, I saw you drop out for a moment. Seems stable now though.</v>

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.600
<v James Wu>Okay grate. Ill upgrade my internet plan this weak. This is getting embarrassing.</v>

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.900
<v Sarah Chen>No worries James. We've all been their with remote work challenges.</v>

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.300
<v Lisa Thompson>Alright, I really need too drop of now. Thanks for the productive meeting everyone!</v>

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.100
<v Sarah Chen>Thanks Lisa. Talk soon!</v>

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:35.600
<v Maria Rodriguez>Me too, I have another meeting in 5 minutes. Buy everyone!</v>

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:41.200
<v David Kim>Same here. Thanks for organizing Sarah. Ill send you that cost breakdown later today.</v>

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.800
<v James Wu>Yep, Ive got too run too. Great meeting everyone!</v>

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:50.400
<v Sarah Chen>Perfect. Thanks everyone for your time and contributions. Have a wonderful day!</v>

<v UNKNOWN SPEAKER>[INAUDIBLE] background noise, typing sounds, someone leaving the meeting</v>

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:28.700
<v Sarah Chen>Oh wait, Maria, before you go - can you also include some user journey mapping in the landing page optimization? I think it would be helpful too understand how users navigate threw the sign up process.</v>

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:42.100
<v Maria Rodriguez>Absolutely, good call. Ill add that too the scope. We can use heat mapping and user session recordings too get insights on user behavior during the sign up flow.</v>

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.500
<v Sarah Chen>Perfect. Thats exactly what I was thinking. Thanks Maria!</v>

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.900

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.900
<v David Kim>I dont see it in my calendar yet.</v>

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.400
<v Sarah Chen>Hmm, let me re-send that. Maybe their was an issue with the calendar integration.</v>

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:27.300
<v David Kim>Thanks Sarah. My calendar has been acting up lately, so it might be on my end.</v>

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:33.800
<v Sarah Chen>Know worries. Ill send it threw outlook instead of Teams calendar. That usually works better.</v>

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.200
<v David Kim>Sounds good. Thanks for following up on that.</v>

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:42.100
<v Sarah Chen>Of coarse. Okay, now Im really signing of. Have a grate day David!</v>
